BENG 182 Protein Database Query Project
The databases and mapping files are not included in the repo. Editing the readFasta.py file allows you to select the sequences from the overall proteome based on their positions in the file (i.e. the first protein sequence in the file is labeled 1). To use you must have many dependencies installed and full-on readme with information on how to go about doing that is yet to come. But if all the proper dependencies are installed, the tool can be run with the command python main.py.
